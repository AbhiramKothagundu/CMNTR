Ravi always wanted to be a doctor, కానీ అతని మిత్రుడు Arun engineer కావాలని అనుకున్నాడు. ఒక రోజు, వారు ఒక seminar attended చేశారు, and the speaker spoke about the importance of balancing work and life. ఇంతలో, Ravi realized that he is more interested in becoming a scientist. "Why should I restrict myself to just one field?" he thought. Arun, on the other hand, was inspired by the speech and decided to pursue his dream of being an engineer.

ఆ రోజు తరువాత, ఇద్దరూ education లో focus చేశారు, and they prepared for their exams with dedication. Ravi studied biology, chemistry, and physics, while Arun concentrated on mathematics and computer science. వారం రోజులు తర్వాత exams వచ్చాయి, and both friends performed exceptionally well. చివరికి, Ravi got into a medical college, and Arun got into an engineering college.
